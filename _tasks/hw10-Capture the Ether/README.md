# HW10 Capture the Ether

Created by Nadir Akhtar (Coinbase and formerly Blockchain at Berkeley) and Simon Zirui Guo.

### About 

In lecture, you learned about what to consider while building a secure blockchain application. Remember we looked at some notable past attacks and what went wrong in their design?

Well, it is always be better to spot those issues before deploying the actual contract on the network. That requires a critical eye to spot these potential vulnerabilities!

In this homework, you will act like a white hat hacker :cowboy_hat_face: to help reveal :mag: vulnerabilities in those smart contracts!



### Capture the Ether!

Capture the flag! :checkered_flag: Well not the flag, but the `ETH` this time!

1. Go to Capture the Ether [site](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/).
2. Choose **any 3** of the challenges listed on the site! You can choose any challenge **except for** the Warmups (`Deploy a contract`, `Call me`, `Choose a nickname`) and the examples Nadir walked through during lecture  (`Guess the number` and `Guess the secret number`).
3. For the 3 challenges you choose, take some time to look at the code, think about where things could have go wrong, and how a malicious hacker can exploit that. For each challenge, write these down in **a few (3-4) sentences**. You do not need to get the exact right answer, but we want to see your thought processes! These things take practice and could be quite fun!

**Note:** You do not need to do the actual challenge by deploying contracts and interact with it, as specified on the capture the ether site. You simply need to look at the code snippets and suggest security vulnerabilities in them. However, if you want to try interact with the actual contracts, feel free!



### Check Off (Closed)

Submit your answers to the 3 challenges to this [form](https://forms.gle/kAAfk8DjEKpozrK79). sssssYou must choose 3 **unique** challenges that we have not examined before to get checked off!
