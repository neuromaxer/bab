## Workload 

Expected pace is 2 Fundamentals Lectures and 1 Dev Lecture per week. However, only the very next lecture can be watched without finishing Problem Set of the previous one (relevant only for Dev course). Dev Lectures weeks can be replaced with Problem Set weeks if necessary. Goal is to finish the course by the end of Feb, 2022. 

| Week  | Fundamentals Lectures | Dev Lectures | Problem Sets | Notes
| ------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | ---
| 1) 22.11.21 - 28.11.21 | 1, 2, 3 | 1 | - | First PS will really benefit from covering Fundamentals Lectures 1-6. So, we will replace the PS and Dev Lecture 2 with additional Fundamentals Lecture to cover all needed material by week 3 
| 2) 29.11.21 - 5.12.21  | 4, 5, 6 | - | - |
| 3) 6.12.21 - 12.12.21 | - | - | 1 | Week dedicated to PS 1 
| 4) 13.12.21 - 19.12.21 | 7 | 2 | 1 | Finish PS 1 and continue with the lectures
